# visited locations

Visited locations is a webapp that allows to create maps of countries you have visited. For some countries, you can also specify subdivisions. For example, US states, or French departments. For example, here is a list of places I have bicycled to: https://visited.renevier.net/ffylbquolomy

Red is for countries. Orange is for US states or French departments. Blue is for US counties.

# Map creation

To create a map, start with a [blank map](https://visited.renevier.net/) and select a list of countries. You can then select subdivisions for countries that support them. To delete a selection, either use undo, or right click to displa a delete button (on desktop only)

# Country boundaries

Data for country and country boundaries comes from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).
